# Acceptance testing with Silk4J and the Robot Framework

The [Robot Framework][5] is a popular open source framework for acceptance testing and acceptance test-driven development. The framework utilizes the keyword-driven testing approach. Since the keywords are implemented in Java, you can easily integrate the framework with Silk4J, the Eclipse plugin of the [Silk Test][3] product.
